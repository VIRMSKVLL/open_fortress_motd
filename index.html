        If you're here and reading this, it must be for one of the following reasons:
        <p>
          1. To playtest a map with random strangers<br>
          2. To play a gamemode not currently findable in the server list<br>
          3. To play privately with friends (hi friend!!!)<br>
          4. I forgot my ports were open and I'm debugging my map clueless of your creepypasta ass existence

      Despite being an ephemeral lobby no different to a traveling circus, even the clowns must set some rules when it comes to clowning around:
   </div>
   <div class="fillContainer">
    <p>
      - No hate of any form, you have imgboards for being shitty<br>
      - Crashing will not be tolerated (unless ur funny)<br>
      - Don't Spam the chat or Voice Chat is bannable<br>
      - Don't Advertize links (Art, and other OF-Servers are fine.)<br>
      - Don't rapidly recconect or "retry" your connection<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fillContainer">
    <p1>
      Don't be afraid to say hi and let me know what you think of the map !<br>
